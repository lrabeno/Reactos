Implement a function called indexOf that takes in strings. The indexOf function takes a "haystack" string, and a "needle" string to search for. So, indexOf("hello world", "or") would return 7. The indexOf function will return the first instance of the needle string. For example indexOf('my name is louis', 'is') would return 8 since the word is happens before the is in louis. MAY NOT USE indexof(). Should return -1 if not found.
